# Placemark

Placemark is a privacy-first, local-first tool for exploring and organizing photos by where and when they were taken.

It allows users to visualize photos on a map using EXIF GPS metadata, filter by date ranges, and optionally organize files based on geographic and temporal selection — without uploading photos or metadata to third-party servers.

## Key Principles

- Local-first: derived metadata stays on the user’s device
- Explicit control: no background scanning or hidden inference
- Multi-source: OneDrive, local folders, and network shares
- Low infrastructure: no backend services required

Placemark is a tool, not a service.

## Status

Early development. Architecture and core concepts are being established.
