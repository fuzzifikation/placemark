## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is alpha software - expect bugs and rough edges
- No auto-update yet - check GitHub for new releases manually
- All data stays local - no cloud services or telemetry

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- ~200MB disk space for app + thumbnail cache

## Installation

1. Download **Placemark Setup 0.1.0.exe** from Assets below
2. Run the installer (Windows will show a SmartScreen warning)
3. Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
4. Launch Placemark from Start Menu

## Known Limitations

- Windows only (macOS/Linux coming in future releases)
- Local folders only (OneDrive integration in Phase 7)
- No file operations yet (copy/move coming in Phase 4)
- Map requires internet for tiles (offline caching in Phase 8)

## What's Next

Phase 4 will add file operations (copy/move photos based on location/date selection).
